**[Version 2.1](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/cupidcr4wl/releases/tag/cupidcr4wl-v2.1)**

cupidcr4wl is an open-source intelligence username and phone number search tool that crawls adult content platforms to see if a targeted account or person is present. The need for a tool of this manner derived from missing persons investigations where dating, adult video/photo platforms, and concerns of human trafficking were found relevant.

![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4fe1b7a-fa3e-4cf0-8321-8a926fc705c3)

cupidcr4wl searches the following platforms:

```Payment and Gifting | Social | Dating and hook-up | Fetish | Adult video and photo | Camming | Escort```

Please see the [contributing](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/cupidcr4wl/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) section if you find cupidcr4wl is returning false positive/negative results so it can be fixed. As web developers update site code, it is inevitabile that at some point certain results may be inaccurate. Contributing is a helpful way of alerting to these inaccuracies so they can be fixed. You can also submit a site to be added to the cupidcr4wl search list!


The site list that cupidcr4wl utilizes for searching is updated for accuracy and expanded regularly.

⚠️**WARNING**⚠️ 

cupidcr4wl **will** search and return results for platforms that host content for mature adult audiences. You are expected to use this tool in accordance with the laws and regulations in your respective jurisdiction(s). If while using cupidcr4wl you believe that you have discovered a platform hosting illegal content, you can utilize the [law enforcement reporting resources](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/cupidcr4wl/blob/main/.github/LEReportingResources.md) section to report it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```python3 cc.py -u username1,username2,username3```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ```python3 cc.py -p 1234567890```

## Web App

cupidcr4wl now ships with an optional Flask web interface that mirrors the command line functionality in your browser.

1. Install the additional dependency (if you have not already):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   flask --app app run
   ```

   The server listens on port 5000 by default. You can also run `python app.py` if you prefer.

3. Open your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and search by username or phone number. Multiple values can be submitted by separating them with commas.

> The web interface shares the same data files (`usernames.json`, `phonenumbers.json`, and `user_agents.txt`) as the CLI version, ensuring consistent search coverage across both experiences.
